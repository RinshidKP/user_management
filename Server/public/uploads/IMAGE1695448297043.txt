Li-Fi, short for "Light Fidelity," is a wireless communication technology that uses visible light to transmit data. It is a bidirectional, high-speed, and energy-efficient alternative to traditional radio frequency (RF) communication methods like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Li-Fi leverages light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to transmit data by modulating the intensity of light rapidly, which is imperceptible to the human eye.
